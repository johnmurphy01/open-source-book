# open-source-book
The purpose of this repo is to try an experiment. The experiment is this:

`What would a novel that has been almost purely open sourced look like? Would it be good?`

## The Core Idea
- __Setting__: Futuristic sci-fi Western. Imagine Firefly(Cowboy Bebop sort of) but also robotic horses(ala Vampire Hunter D). Interplanetary travel is possible but a lot of the civilizations have reverted back to more "main street" strips with outlying farms and/or settlements
- __Main Character__: A silent type. Imagine The Man With No Name
- __Theme/Overarching Plot__: I'm looking for help here. I'll open an issue for ideas and update this when something is nailed down.

## Project Structure
I have created folders for character and locations. Each one will get their own Mardown file. This is where character and location profiles will live. At the top level, I have `book.md` which will contain...wait for it....the book. As we need other folders, I will make them and update this document.

## Writing Standards
- __Spelling__: Please try to proofread and look for spelling errors. I will also proofread before accepting/denying the change but a good look beforehand would be great.
- __Single Space after periods__: I have a hard time with this as well(this readme is already probably in violation), so I understand but please try your best.
- __Double spaced line spacing__: Give the line room to breathe

## How to Submit a change request(PR)
This is a pretty straightforward guide for creating a Pull Request.

## My Pull Request was not accepted...
I will always try to provide transparent feedback on the changes. Maybe I don't think the idea would mesh well with the existing narrative. Maybe there's something to the content that isn't appropriate. Whatever the reason, I will provide a detailed explanation. This does not mean the Pull Request is useless. You are free to make any modifications and then re-submit. Also, because of the open source nature of this experiement, you can take your idea and run with it!

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is simply a text format. Here is a great source/cheat sheet for writing markdown: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

## What can I use to edit?
Pretty much anything that understands Markdown! You can edit files directly here on Github. There's an online product called Dillinger(https://dillinger.io/) that I really like. As a programmer, I use Visual Studio Code but I understand that may be too much.

## I am not a technical person and need help
I am willing to help as much as possible to get over the technical hump of this experiment. Feel free to DM me at @johnmurphy01 on Twitter or create an issue here on Github or email me at jmichealmurphy@gmail.com. Make sure the subject line of the email has `open-source-book` somewhere in it.

## Contributions
All contributions will be cited in the novel and here in this document.
